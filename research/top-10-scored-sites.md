## Recommendations for GridSite Model

1. **Flag still-operating plants**: Rockport (#1), Four Corners (#5), and Monroe (#6) should not rank as retirement opportunities. Consider adding an "operating — retirement announced" status distinct from truly retired plants.

2. **Track competitor activity**: J.M. Stuart (#3) and Homer City (#4) already have active data center proposals. Widows Creek (#9) has Google. These are validated sites but not acquisition targets.

3. **Best actual opportunity**: W.H. Sammis (#8) is the standout — retired, being demolished by a purpose-built remediation company, actively marketed for data centers, no tenant signed, existing 345-kV transmission, Ohio incentives in place.

4. **Environmental screening needed**: Coal ash liabilities at Joliet 29 (#7) and San Juan (#10) are significant barriers that the current scoring model doesn't capture.
