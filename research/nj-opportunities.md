# New Jersey Data Center Opportunity Analysis

*Generated: February 24, 2026*

## Executive Summary

New Jersey offers a dense retired power plant inventory with exceptional proximity to high-voltage transmission, premium PJM/NYISO electricity pricing, and strong state incentives ($500M Next NJ AI program). However, the market faces severe PJM interconnection congestion (8+ year queue timelines), growing community opposition, and an uncertain regulatory landscape with competing pro- and anti-data center legislation.

**Grid Profile:**
- 197 substations ≥100kV (11 at 500kV, 10 at 345kV)
- 23 retired power plants totaling ~6,646 MW
- PJM territory with LMPs of $43-45/MWh (PSEG/JCPL zones)
- Adjacent to NYISO Zone J ($52.8/MWh) — premium pricing zone
- 81.3 GW of queue withdrawals — signals high demand but severe congestion

**Market Context:**
- Existing DC inventory: 531 MW at 4% vacancy
- PSE&G large load pipeline: 9.4 GW (only 10-20% expected to materialize)
- Major active projects: Nebius/DataOne 300 MW (Vineland), CoreWeave $1.8B (Kenilworth)
- Average electricity rate: 24.88 cents/kWh (9th highest nationally)
