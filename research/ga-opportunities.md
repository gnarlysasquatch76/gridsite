# Georgia Data Center Opportunity Analysis

*Generated: February 24, 2026*

## Executive Summary

Georgia has the strongest 500kV transmission backbone of any state we've analyzed (31 substations at 500kV), a massive retired coal plant inventory near high-voltage nodes, and the fastest-growing data center market in the U.S. However, the market is rapidly saturating: Georgia Power has 7,900 MW of signed DC contracts, key retired plant sites are being repurposed for new gas generation rather than sold, and the 2026 legislative session is advancing moratorium bills and tax incentive repeals.

**Grid Profile:**
- 446 substations ≥100kV (31 at 500kV, 0 at 345kV — grid jumps from 500kV to 230kV)
- 9 retired power plants totaling ~6,055 MW
- Non-ISO territory (Southern Company / Georgia Power) — no transparent LMP pricing
- No OASIS ATC data available (vertically integrated utility)
- 102.7 GW of queue withdrawals (367 projects) — dominated by solar (25 GW)

**Market Context:**
- Georgia Power has **7,900 MW** of signed data center contracts + 3 GW additional finalized
- PSC approved **9,885 MW (~10 GW)** of new generation capacity ($16B+ investment)
- Metro Atlanta is the **fastest-growing DC market** in the U.S.
- Key developers: QTS/Microsoft, DC BLOX, T5, Meta, Switch, Digital Realty
- **Moratorium bills** and **tax exemption repeal bills** advancing in 2026 session

## Grid Infrastructure

### Utility Territory

Georgia Power (Southern Company subsidiary) is the dominant investor-owned utility serving most of the state including all major data center corridors. Oglethorpe Power serves Electric Membership Cooperatives and co-owns some generation assets.

**Key difference from PJM states:** Georgia Power operates a vertically integrated model with no ISO/RTO participation. There is no public interconnection queue, no transparent LMP pricing, and no OASIS ATC reporting. Large load connections are negotiated directly with Georgia Power under a PSC-approved "Large Load" tariff (created January 2025).

### High-Voltage Substation Network

| Tier | Count | Top Hubs |
|------|-------|----------|
| **500kV** | 31 | Norcross (18 lines), Bonaire (15), Bowen (12), Villa Rica (12), O'Hara (12) |
| **230kV** | 391 | Distributed across state |
| **161kV** | 24 | Mostly rural areas |

**Notable:** Georgia has nearly **3x the 500kV substations** of New Jersey (31 vs 11). The grid backbone radiates from the Atlanta metro through Norcross (NE), Villa Rica (W), O'Hara (S), Union (SW), and Big Shanty (NW). Bonaire (15 lines) is the major central Georgia hub.

### Generation Fleet

| Category | Capacity | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Natural Gas (CC + CT + Steam) | 18,437 MW | Primary generation source |
| Nuclear (Vogtle 1-4) | 6,506 MW | Includes new Units 3 & 4 |
| Coal | 6,172 MW | Declining; Bowen/Scherer still operating |
| Solar PV | 4,663 MW | Rapidly growing |
| Hydro (conventional + pumped) | 3,308 MW | Including Rocky Mountain pumped storage |
| Other (biomass, petroleum, pet coke, batteries) | 2,408 MW | Diverse fleet |
| **Total Operating** | **41,494 MW** | — |

### Queue Withdrawals: 367 projects, 102,728 MW

| Fuel | Projects | MW | Share |
|------|----------|----|-------|
| Gas | 81 | 53,852 | 52% |
| Solar | 193 | 25,006 | 24% |
| Solar+Battery | 51 | 12,057 | 12% |
| Coal | 9 | 6,110 | 6% |
| Battery | 28 | 4,775 | 5% |
| Other/Wind | 5 | 928 | 1% |

**Key insight:** All queue entities are SOCO (Southern Company). The massive 102.7 GW of withdrawals (higher than NJ's 81.3 GW) signals intense developer interest. The solar-heavy profile (193 projects, 25 GW) reflects Georgia's strong solar resource but also significant project attrition.

## Georgia Power Capacity Expansion Plan

The PSC approved a $16B+ expansion on December 19, 2025, including:

| Investment | Details | Timeline |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **New gas plants** | Combined-cycle units at Bowen, Wansley, and McIntosh sites | 2028-2031 |
| **Battery storage** | Multiple utility-scale installations | 2026-2030 |
| **Solar + storage** | Paired generation/storage projects | Ongoing |
| **Transmission** | 1,000+ miles of new lines | 2026-2031 |
| **Hydro modernization** | 9 existing dams upgraded | 2026-2030 |
| **Coal-to-gas cofiring** | Plants Bowen and Scherer | Near-term |

**Critical implication:** Georgia Power is building new gas generation **at the same retired coal plant sites** (Wansley, Bowen, McIntosh) that would otherwise be top data center opportunities. These sites were selected precisely because they already have transmission, water, and land.

## Competitive Landscape

### Active Data Center Projects

| Developer | Location | Capacity/Size | Investment | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **QTS / Microsoft** | Fayetteville (Fayette Co.) | 278 MW, 615 acres | Multi-billion | First AI "superfactory" opened Nov 2025 |
| **DC BLOX Atlanta East** | Conyers (Rockdale Co.) | 216 MW, 750K sqft | N/A | Phase 1 under construction |
| **DC BLOX Atlanta West** | Lithia Springs (Douglas Co.) | 120→200 MW | N/A | Under development |
| **T5 Atlanta IV** | South Fulton County | 200 MW critical IT | N/A | Utility service 2026; Phase 1 delivery 2027 |
| **Microsoft Palmetto** | Douglasville (Douglas Co.) | Not disclosed | N/A | Phase I construction started 2024 |
| **Meta Stanton Springs** | Social Circle (Walton Co.) | ~2M sqft total | N/A | Phased expansion through 2032 |
| **Switch "The KEEP"** | Lithia Springs (Douglas Co.) | 150 MW | N/A | Operational; expanding to 1.1M sqft |
| **Taurus DC / Digital Realty** | Metro Atlanta | 8.6M sqft proposed | N/A | Rezoning filed |
| **Digital Realty ATL 15-16** | Forest Park (Clayton Co.) | ~200 MW, 97 acres | N/A | Under development |

**Total signed DC contracts with Georgia Power: 7,900 MW + 3 GW additional = ~11 GW**

### Market Saturation Assessment

The metro Atlanta DC market is approaching saturation with 11+ GW of contracted demand against 10 GW of approved new generation (not online until 2028-2031). This creates:
1. **Near-term power gap** (2026-2028) — limited available capacity
2. **Premium on sites with existing grid interconnection** — retired plant sites
3. **Geographic expansion pressure** — developers moving to rural Georgia megasites

## Incentives & Regulatory Environment

### Current Incentives (Active but Threatened)

| Incentive | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Sales & Use Tax Exemption** | Complete exemption on qualifying DC equipment; $25M-$250M minimum investment |
| **Job Creation Requirement** | 25 "quality jobs" in one county or 50 statewide in two years |
| **Brownfield Property Tax** | 40% of fair market value for 10 years |
| **GRAD Site Certification** | 60 pre-certified sites with expedited permitting |
| **Enterprise Zones** | Additional property tax abatements in distressed areas |

**Economic impact:** $474M in foregone state tax revenue in FY 2025. State audit found only 30% of data centers directly attributable to the exemption.

### 2026 Legislative Threats

| Bill | Sponsor | What It Does | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **SB 410** | Sen. Matt Brass (R-Newnan) | Repeals sales tax exemption for new DCs; grandfathers existing | Introduced Jan 15, 2026 |
| **SB 408** | GA Senate | Sunsets sales tax break on Jan 1, 2027 | Introduced 2026 |
| **SB 436** | GA Senate | Suspends new exemption certificates July 2026 - June 2027 | Introduced 2026 |
| **HB 559** | GA House | Sunsets sales tax exemption Dec 31, 2026 | Introduced 2026 |
| **HB 1012** | Rep. Romman (D-Duluth) | Statewide construction moratorium until Feb 2027 | Introduced Jan 2026 |

**Key context:** Georgia Senate has **passed** a bill to suspend DC tax exemptions. Governor Kemp previously **vetoed** a similar bill, signaling executive support for the industry — but political pressure is mounting. DeKalb County has already enacted a local DC moratorium extended to June 2026.

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Factors
1. **Legislative uncertainty**: 5 active bills targeting DC incentives/development in 2026 session
2. **Site availability**: Top retired plant sites (Wansley, Bowen) being repurposed for gas generation
3. **Capacity constraints**: 11 GW contracted vs 10 GW approved new generation (not online until 2028-2031)
4. **No market transparency**: No ISO/RTO, no public interconnection queue, no LMP data
5. **Remediation timelines**: Harllee Branch in 15-year cleanup; Hammond ash cap-in-place

### Moderate Risk Factors
1. **Community opposition**: DeKalb County moratorium; growing suburban resistance
2. **Ratepayer politics**: $474M in foregone tax revenue fueling legislative backlash
3. **Georgia Power control**: All interconnection negotiated bilaterally — no competitive process

### Favorable Factors
1. **Strongest 500kV backbone** we've analyzed (31 substations)
2. **Governor support**: Kemp has vetoed anti-DC legislation
3. **State megasites**: 1,100-2,000 acre certified sites available
4. **Deep existing ecosystem**: Major developers (QTS, DC BLOX, Microsoft, Meta, Switch) all active
5. **Rivian site**: ~2,000 acres could become available if EV plans abandoned
6. **Lower power costs**: Regulated utility rates, no market-based LMP premiums

---

## Recommended Outreach Targets

### Immediate Priority

1. **Plant Hammond** (953 MW) — Rome, Floyd County. Coal ash remediation complete. 25.8 mi from Bowen 500kV (12 lines). No announced redevelopment. Georgia Power owns. **Best available retired plant site in GA.**

2. **Plant Atkinson** (282 MW) — Smyrna, Cobb County. Atlanta metro location. 11.8 mi from Bull Sluice 500kV (8 lines). NG steam plant retired. Urban setting with fiber/labor access.

3. **Middle Georgia Megasite** (1,100 acres) — Peach County. State-owned, certified, marketed. Adjacent I-75. Would need new transmission build-out.

### Watch List

4. **Rivian Site** (~2,000 acres) — Morgan/Walton Counties. Construction paused since March 2024. If Rivian abandons plans, this becomes the largest available industrial site in Georgia near I-20 and existing infrastructure.

5. **Plant Harllee Branch** (1,746 MW) — Putnam County. Massive capacity but in 15-year remediation. Long-term play (2030+). Major 500kV hub nearby.

6. **Heart of Georgia Mega Site** (2,000 acres) — Laurens County. Shovel-ready but rural location. Better for hyperscale campus than colocation.

### Sites to Avoid

7. **Wansley** — Already committed for Georgia Power new gas generation.
8. **Bowen** — Still operating coal + new gas units approved.
9. **Scherer** — Operating until ~2038; massive ash pond liability.
10. **McIntosh** — Retooled (gas units remain operational).
