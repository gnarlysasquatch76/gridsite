## Recommendations

1. **Immediate outreach targets**: W.H. Sammis (ETEM), Hatfields Ferry (FirstEnergy), Monticello TX (CLP) — all genuinely available with strong grid interconnection
2. **Watch list**: J.M. Stuart (1.3 GW filing could stall in PJM queue 2+ years), Collins Station (dormant but 2,650 MW interconnection history)
3. **Remove from scored list**: Winner Park, Mt. Washington School, Hardesty Federal Complex, Riverfront Landfill — all taken for non-industrial use
4. **Model improvement**: Add "competitor activity" flag to scoring model to deprioritize sites with known data center proposals
